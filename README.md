# Pokedex App
This is a Java-based Pokedex app that uses the HTTP API to display information about Pokemon.

The app features a search section where users can search for a Pokemon by name, and upon clicking a Pokemon, a new layout is displayed showing its details, such as weight, height, and stats including HP, attack, defense, and speed. The image of the Pokemon is displayed as a GIF.

The app is simple and easy to use.

# API Used
This app does not use an external API. Instead, it uses a JSON file (available at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Biuni/PokemonGO-Pokedex/master/pokedex.json) to store information about the Pokemon. 

This allows the app to work offline and without relying on an external service.
